#summary Summary of iD-GPU project.

= Introduction =

The current version has the following capabilities:

  * Molecular dynamics simulation of uranium dioxide
  * Isolated boundary conditions (systems with free surface)
  * Approximation of pair potentials and rigid ions
  * Using GPU for computation of pair forces and energy
  * Computation of lattice period and total energy of the system

= Requirements =

== For execution: ==
  * 64-bit version of Microsoft Windows
  * Microsoft DirectX 11
  * Microsoft .NET Framework 4.0
  * DirectX 11 compatible graphics card (CPU-only computation is also possible)

== For compilation: ==
  * Microsoft Visual C# 2010

= Input and output =

You need to specify parameters of simulation in the source code except the sets of pair potentials and some parameters influencing speed of GPU computation.

The progress of simulation is shown in the title of the window and its single textbox.

Regularly the program save results to a file.
