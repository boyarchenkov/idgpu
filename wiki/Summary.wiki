#summary Summary of iD-GPU project.

= Introduction =

The current version has the following capabilities:

  * Molecular dynamics simulation of uranium dioxide
  * Isolated boundary conditions (systems with free surface)
  * Approximation of pair potentials and rigid ions
  * Using GPU for computation of pair forces and energy
  * Computation of lattice period and total energy of the system

= Requirements =

== For execution: ==
  * 64-bit version of Microsoft Windows
  * Microsoft DirectX 11
  * Microsoft .NET Framework 4.0
  * DirectX 11 compatible graphics card (CPU-only computation is also possible)

== For compilation: ==
  * Microsoft Visual C# 2010

= Input and output =

You need to specify parameters of simulation in the source code except the sets of pair potentials.

The progress of simulation is shown in the program window
