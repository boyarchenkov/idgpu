#summary Summary of iD-GPU project.

= Introduction =

Current version has the following capabilities:

* Molecular dynamics simulation of uranium dioxide
* Isolated boundary conditions (systems with free surface)
* Approximation of pair potentials and rigid ions
* Using GPU for computation of pair forces and energy

= Requirements =

* 64-bit version of Microsoft Windows
* DirectX 11
* Microsoft .NET Framework 4.0
* DirectX 11 compatible graphics card (CPU-only computation is also possible)
